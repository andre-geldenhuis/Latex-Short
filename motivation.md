## Why Choose LaTeX?

- The output looks great -- more professional than MS office
    - an example goes here
- You can focus on the actual writing, rather than the formatting
- When you DO come to do the formatting, it's easy to RELIABLY make global changes

## Other great things about LaTeX

- You can get a lot of control with a little effort
- Independent of your computer’s platform -- you can open tex files on any system AND it’s free.
    - Free as in speech and free as in beer

## Other great things about LaTeX

- The output is trustworthy and consistent
    - You won't get random changes of font
    - When you change the document settings, it changes them everywhere
    - So it won't matter if you forget to select say your figure captions
    - You can automatically create your table of contents AND have it link to the right parts of your document

## Other great things about LaTeX

- Numbering is done automatically
    - You can shuffle around pieces of your document without worrying about the order
    - Things that update automatically:
        - section/chapter numbering
        - Figures/tables/schemes (also known as "floats")
        - Equations and compounds -- you can even get automatic numbering to happen WITHIN your scheme images


## Other great things about LaTeX

- It's very easy to make shortcuts (also known as macros)
    - -- give some examples -- chemistry coupling constants, long words, words with accents
  

## Other great things about LaTeX

- A new line doesn't mean a new paragraph, which is really great for lists of data
    - e.g chemistry NMR list
    - some other example that's not from chemistry
  
## Other great things about LaTeX

- You can choose your level of use (or a better way of saying this)
    - You can stick to the basics, and it will look great
    - OR you can get really involved in styles and formatting control -- there are many fancy things you can do!
  
## Common complaints about LaTeX and why they're wrong

- You have to learn how to code
    - Not really.  There are a few commands that you have to use, but they're more like keyboard shortcuts (e.g. ctrl+B for bold) than proper coding
- Some more things -- steep learning curve
    - Word also has a steep learning curve for anything more than the basics!

## Other things to incorporate
 
- an explanation of the difference between LaTeX and word (WYSIWYG vs write now, typeset later [or a nicer way of saying that])
