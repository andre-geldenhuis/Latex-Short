We have also prepared a large example document with as many features
as we could cram in.  Sarah has shared it on ShareLaTeX [here](https://www.sharelatex.com/project/5542ba6d65ac94b22149d343).
It is an excellent reference for how to do many things like multi file documents etc and we
will be referring to it in the second half.

This lesson is available on github, if you would like to suggest a change
